# The numpy stack tool-set

The Numpy stack is a combination of tools used for deep learning and machine learning problems. It is made up of five different libraries within python to provide tools for doing calculus, linear algebra, and probability. This repository has some basic samples for using these tool-sets for machine learning projects.



#### Numpy Samples

- matrix multiplication speed test

- matrix dot product speed test

  

#### Matplotlib Samples

- plotting for various charts

- plotting images

- plotting a dataset with an XOR logic gate

  

#### Pandas Samples

- importing datasets from CSV

- generating datasets to CSV

  

#### Scipy Samples

- Image processing - blur filter application

- Image processing - edge detection application

  

#### SciKit-Learn Samples

- Classification using Ensemble model (Random Forest)
- Regression using Ensemble model (Random Forest)
- Classification using  MLP deep learning neural network
- Classification using Support Vector Machine
